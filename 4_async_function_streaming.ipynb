      "- **Quick Review & Learn (20-30 mins):**\n",
      "  - Skim through or watch a short tutorial video on agentic AI fundamentals.\n",
      "  - Focus on concepts like autonomous agents, reinforcement learning, decision-making frameworks, and AI planning.\n",
      "- **Set a Focused Goal:**\n",
      "  - Write a small learning goal for the day (e.g., understand basic autonomous agent architecture or implement a simple agent in Python).\n",
      "  \n",
      "#### During Work Breaks (10-15 minutes)\n",
      "- **Micro-learning & Practice:**\n",
      "  - Read a quick blog post, article, or flashcards about agentic AI.\n",
      "  - Try mental exercises: think about how an autonomous agent would behave in a simple scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Evening (After Work – 1 to 1.5 hours)\n",
      "- **Deep Dive Learning:**\n",
      "  - Study a chapter or section from a recommended book or course (e.g., Reinforcement Learning by Sutton & Barto, or an online course on autonomous agents).\n",
      "  - Watch in-depth videos or lectures.\n",
      "- **Hands-on Practice:**\n",
      "  - Implement simple projects or experiments in Python related to agentic AI (like coding an agent that learns a simple task).\n",
      "  - Use platforms such as OpenAI Gym or custom environments to train and test agents.\n",
      "- **Note-Taking & Reflection:**\n",
      "  - Write down what you learned, challenges faced, and questions to explore further.\n",
      "  - Summarize key takeaways in a personal knowledge base or notebook.\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Limit Digital Distractions:** Use apps/plugins to block distracting sites during study time.\n",
      "- **Accountability:** Share your progress weekly with a friend or on social media.\n",
      "- **Flexible Adaptation:** On busy workdays, do shorter reviews or micro-learning instead of deep study.\n",
